This work aims to evaluate the performance of two neural network architectures, U-Net and SegNet, for image segmentation in the search for COVID-19 affected areas in lungs of people infected by COVID-19.
Experimentation included the modification of hyperparameters, the number of layers and regularisation techniques, such as Batch Normalization and Drop Out, to assess their impact on performance. 
The results showed that U-Net achieved a pixel accuracy of 95.48% and an IoU of 95.30%, beating SegNet, which achieved 94.04% in accuracy and 93.97% in IoU. Refered articule:
